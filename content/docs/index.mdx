# ðŸ“„ MDX File Format

When creating documentation pages, each `.mdx` file should follow a clear structure that combines **frontmatter metadata** with **Markdown/MDX content**.

---

## 1. Frontmatter

At the top of every file, include YAML frontmatter to describe the page.  
This helps organize docs, generate navigation, and apply metadata.

```mdx

## 2. File Naming and Format

- Every documentation file **must end with `.mdx`**.  
  Example: `sample.mdx`, `getting-started.mdx`

- The content inside an MDX file **follows standard Markdown syntax**, which means you can use:

  - Headings (`#`, `##`, `###`)
  - Lists (`-` or `1.`)
  - Links (`[text](url)`)
  - Images (`![alt](url)`)
  - Additionally, you can include React components directly in your Markdown, making MDX powerful for interactive documentation.
