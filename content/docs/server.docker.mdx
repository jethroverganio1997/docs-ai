## 🐳 Docker Container Commands

### 📄 List running containers
```bash
sudo docker ps
```
**Description:** Shows all currently running Docker containers, including their IDs, images, status, and exposed ports.

---

### 🖥️ Execute a shell in a running container
```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> sh
```
**Description:** Opens a shell session inside a running container.  
**Example with IP address inspection:**
```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> sh -c "ip addr" 
# sample traefic container id
```
**Note:** Use `sudo` if your user does not have Docker socket access.

---

### 🌐 Get container IP address
```bash
docker inspect -f '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' <container_id>
```
**Description:** Retrieves the IP address of a container for a specific network.

---

## 🛠️ Docker Network Commands

### 📋 List all Docker networks
```bash
sudo docker network ls
```
**Description:** Displays all Docker networks including bridge, overlay, host, and custom networks.

---

### 🔍 Inspect a specific Docker network
```bash
sudo docker network inspect <network_name>
```
**Description:** Shows detailed network information:
* Name, ID, driver
* Subnet and gateway (IPAM configuration)
* Containers attached to the network
* Options and labels
* Peers (for overlay networks in Swarm)

**Examples:**
```bash
sudo docker network inspect bridge
sudo docker network inspect dokploy-network
```

---

## ⚠️ Common Docker Errors

### 🔒 Permission denied
```text
permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock
```
**Solution:** Use `sudo` or add your user to the `docker` group:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

### ❌ Unknown Docker command
```bash
docker ls
```
**Reason:** `docker ls` is not valid. Use `docker ps` or `docker images` instead.

## 📝 Notes on Docker Networking

* **Bridge network (`bridge`)**: Default network for single-host communication. Example subnet: `172.17.0.0/16`  
* **Overlay network (`dokploy-network`)**: Used in Swarm for multi-host communication. Example subnet: `10.0.1.0/24`  
* **Multiple interfaces:** Containers may have multiple IPs (`eth0`, `eth1`, `eth2`). Firewall rules must allow all relevant subnets for services to communicate properly.
