# 📄 MDX File Format

When creating documentation pages, each `.mdx` file should follow a clear structure that combines **frontmatter metadata** with **Markdown/MDX content**.

---

## 📝 1. Frontmatter

At the top of every file, include YAML frontmatter to describe the page.  
This helps organize docs, generate navigation, and apply metadata.

```mdx

## 📂 2. File Naming and Format

- 📌 Every documentation file must end with .mdx.
Example: mobile.sample.mdx, mobile.getting-started.mdx

- 🏷️ The first word (before the dot) should be one of:
mobile, frontend, backend, api, or server.

## ✍️ 3. Content Rules

The content inside an MDX file follows standard Markdown syntax, which means you can use:

- 🔠 Headings (#, ##, ###)

- 📋 Lists (- or 1.)

- 🔗 Links ([text](url))

- 🖼️ Images (![alt](url))

- ⚛️ React components — You can embed interactive components directly in your docs, making MDX more powerful than plain Markdown.
