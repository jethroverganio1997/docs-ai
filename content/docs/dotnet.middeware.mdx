# Adding Middleware in .NET

Middleware in .NET is software that sits in the HTTP pipeline and processes requests and responses.  
You can use built-in middleware (like authentication, routing, CORS) or create your own.

## 1. Built-in Middleware

In `.NET 6+` (minimal hosting model), middleware is added in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

// Example: Use built-in middleware
app.UseRouting();
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

app.MapControllers();

app.Run();
```
